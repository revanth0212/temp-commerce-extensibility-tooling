2. Ensure all `.mdc` files are present in the directory
3. The rules will automatically be applied when working with Adobe Commerce extensions

## Usage

### Getting Started

When you request Adobe Commerce extension development, the AI will:

1. **Check for REQUIREMENTS.md** - Look for existing requirements or create one
2. **Gather requirements** - Ask clarifying questions about your specific needs
3. **Present architectural plan** - Show the proposed solution structure
4. **Generate code** - Create App Builder-based extension code
5. **Provide documentation** - Include diagrams and implementation guides

### Example Request

```
"I need to create an extension that syncs new customers from my Adobe Commerce store to our CRM when they register."
```

The AI will guide you through:
- Target environment selection (PaaS/SaaS/Both)
- Event triggering mechanism confirmation
- External API integration details
- Application type selection (headless vs SPA)
- State management requirements
- Testing preferences

### Supported Patterns

- **Customer Data Synchronization** - Sync customer data to external CRMs
- **Order Processing Workflows** - Handle order events and notifications
- **Product Catalog Integration** - Sync product data with external systems
- **Inventory Management** - Stock level synchronization
- **Shipping Notifications** - Logistics system integrations

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's
- Always use the Integration Starter Kit structure
- Store secrets in App Builder default parameters
- Implement proper input validation
- Use IMS authentication for SaaS compatibility
- Follow the four-phase development process
- Document requirements in REQUIREMENTS.md

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- Never modify Adobe Commerce core files
- Don't store secrets in .env files for production
- Avoid in-process PHP extensions for SaaS
- Don't skip the requirements clarification phase
- Never assume missing information

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing for Your Team

The rules can be adapted for specific needs:

1. **Security Requirements** - Add team-specific security measures
2. **Coding Standards** - Enforce specific naming conventions
3. **Application Types** - Focus on SPA vs headless patterns
4. **Logging Libraries** - Mandate specific logging tools

### Environment-Specific Adaptations

- **PaaS-focused teams** - Emphasize composer and git-based workflows
- **SaaS-focused teams** - Emphasize API-only integration patterns
- **Security-sensitive environments** - Add compliance requirements

## Decision Matrix: PaaS vs SaaS

| Feature | PaaS | SaaS | Agent Behavior |
|---------|------|------|----------------|
| **Extensibility** | In-process & Out-of-process | Out-of-process only | Default to out-of-process |
| **Authentication** | IMS optional | IMS mandatory | Use IMS for future-proofing |
| **API Endpoints** | Separate Core/Catalog | Unified endpoint | Conditional URL selection |
| **Events** | XML or REST | Admin UI or REST | Query for event names |
